# BEM Methodology

When we develop a website using a component-based framework like `Vue.js` or
`Nuxt.js`, each component, includes its own styles within the component file.
This approach makes it easier to manage styles within each component. However,
when considering the code as a whole, managing these styles can become
challenging and difficult to recall. To overcome this obstacle, we researched
the BEM(Block Element Modifier) methodology to ensure stable development.
