## learn-sass

Learning how to use scss styles in html pages.

### Using `scss` in Html Page

When we use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), we prefer Scss syntax. For Css,
we convert Scss to Css with Sass. We prefer to install `npm` instead of `brew`
or `choco` to have a simple single run file. We use `npx sass` for convenience.

### Using Variables

We use variables to make it easier to apply the theme's colors and fonts and
to improve readability.
